# Nikhil's README file

This repo is built as part of MSDS6306 Week 3 BLT exercise.

It contains a clone of Dr. McGee's repo: https://github.com/MonnieMcGee/stat6306introdatascience
In addition it contains skills.png describing my self assessment of data science skills.

This is the master readme file for this repo. This had to be names with _NG at the end since there was already a README file in Dr. McGee's folder that was clones here.
